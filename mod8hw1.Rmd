 ### homework problem 1
### a) 
1-ppois(q = 8, lambda = 15)
### b)
dpois(x = 0, lambda = 15)
### c)
dpois(x = 3, lambda = 15)
### d)
x <- 0:30
l = 15
probset <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l)
barplot(probset, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "x", ylab = "Pr(X = x)", main = "Probability Mass Function")
### e)
Master <- rpois(n = 104, 15)
### f)
hist(Master, xlim = c(0,30))
### the shape of the histogram is very similar to that of the Probability Mass Function, with only a slight skew to the left, not seen in the P. mass function plot, which is symmetrical ###
